An engine that is a modified version of Psych Engine, and trying to fix mistakes from DarkMoonEngine.

This engine includes:
- Stage Editor
- Winning icons
- Long ass health bar
- More options
- Week 7
- New note mechanics
- Much more!

If you need any help on coding, I recommend going to Psych Engine's wiki page, since like the description says, it's a modified version of Psych Engine.
